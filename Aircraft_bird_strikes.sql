--2. Top Aircraft Types with the Most Bird Strike Damage

/*select aircraft, Count(aircraft_damage)

-- Answer: Top Three (1.Southwest airlines, 2. United airlines 3. American airlines)
/*select operator, count(operator) birds_favorites
from flight_data
group by operator
order by birds_favorites desc;*/

--4. What birds are striking â€” and where? Do certain bird species tend to strike specific parts of the aircraft more than others?
-- Answer: GULLs lead all bird species in strike frequency, with a clear preference for hitting the wing and rotor areas. 
-- Sparrows tend to go for the windshield, while European Starlings also frequently strike the wing and rotor. 
-- Barn Swallows appear to favor the front of the aircraft, most often impacting the windshield and nose.

--5. Which bird species cause the most damage, and to which parts of the aircraft? 
-- Answer: The Black-bellied Whistling Duck is responsible for the least amount of damage, while the Canada Goose most frequently damages the wing or rotor and the nose of the aircraft.
-- Gulls also tend to favor the wing or rotor area.

--7. At what point in the aircrafts journey do birds like to strike?
-- Answer: Top Three (1. Approach, 2. Takeoff Run 3. Landing Roll)
/*select flight_phase, count(species_name) as birds
from flight_data
WHERE flight_phase IS NOT NULL
group by flight_phase

--8. Which birds like to strike when the plane is approaching the runway?

/*Select species_name, count(species_name) species_count
from flight_data
WHERE flight_phase = 'APPROACH'
GROUP BY species_name
ORDER BY species_count desc;*/

--9. Do birds have a preferred time of year to strike planes?
-- Answer:(Summer months: 1.August 2.September 3.July)
/*SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(incident_month, 'MM'), 'Month') AS month_name,
  COUNT(*) AS total_strikes
FROM flight_data

ORDER BY total_strikes DESC;*/

--10. Do more strikes happen during the day or at night?
-- Answer: Daytime accounts for nearly half of all bird strikes, with night and dusk following behind.
