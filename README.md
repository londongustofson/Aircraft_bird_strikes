# Aircraft_bird_strikes

This project analyzes bird strike incidents using SQL on a dataset called flight_data. Key findings and insights include:

Most Frequently Struck Bird: 
Mourning Dove is the most commonly involved species in bird strikes.

Aircraft Most Affected: 
B-737-300, B-737-700, and A-320 aircraft experience the most strike-related damage.

Airlines with the Most Strikes: 
Southwest, United, and American Airlines are the top three most frequently struck.

Strike Locations on Aircraft:
Gulls mostly strike the wing or rotor.

Sparrows often hit the windshield.
Barn Swallows commonly impact the windshield and nose.

Birds Causing Most Damage:
Canada Goose leads in severe damage, especially to the wing and nose.
Gulls also contribute significantly to wing or rotor damage.
White-tailed deer were noted for tail damage.

Most Common Types of Damage:
Wing or rotor
Nose
Windshield

Strike Timing During Flights:
Most strikes occur during approach, followed by takeoff run and landing roll.

Birds Striking During Approach: Gull, European Starling, and Sparrow are most active.

Seasonal Trends: Bird strikes peak in August, September, and July.

Time of Day: Strikes are most frequent during daylight hours, followed by night and dusk.

These insights were generated using SQL queries to group, filter, and aggregate data from the flight_data table. The project aims to support aviation safety and is intended for educational use.
